**Office Hours:** Posted on Canvas  
**Meetings:** Tu&Th 10:00 – 11:50pm, Furman 102  
**E-mail:** coffmaju@oregonstate.edu (Email should be a secondary contact for course questions with the primary contact being Canvas messaging.)  
**TA Info:** Preethi Kurapaty – kurapatp@oregonstate.edu  

## Textbooks:
  - [*Introduction to Algorithms*](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/osu/detail.action?docID=3339142) by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, Stein, 3rd Edition.
  - [*Algorithms*](http://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/) by Jeff Erickson, 1st Edition.

## Canvas:
Announcements, office hours, weekly homework assignments, readings and other course information will be placed on Canvas.

## Course Content:
- Analyzing algorithms for correctness and running time.
- Divide and Conquer and the use of recurrences to analyze recursive algorithms.
- Dynamic Programming
- Graph Algorithms
- Complexity Classes
- Heuristics and Approximation Algorithms

## Measureable Student Learning Outcomes:
1. Define O, Ω, and θ in a rigorous way
2. Solve simple recurrence relations
3. Implement a recursive algorithm to solve a simple problem
4. Prove the correctness of algorithms using induction
5. Implement a divide-and-conquer algorithm to solve a problem of intermediate difficulty
6. Implement a polynomial-time heuristic algorithm to solve an NP-hard problem
7. Explain how a problem is shown to be NP-complete

## Evaluation of Student Performance:
Scores for coursework items will be posted on Canvas & Gradescope as they are graded. Feedback will be provided when available. You will submit coursework items through Gradescope and/or TEACH before 23:59 (TEACH server time, Pacific Time Zone) on the date they are due, be sure you give yourself an hour or more to submit coursework.

## Grade Evaluation:
Your course grade will be based on the following:

Type | %
--- | ---
Homework | 50%
Quizzes 2 @ 10% | 20%
In-Class Activities | 15%
Final Exam | 15%
**TOTAL** | **100%**

## Homework:
There are five individual homework assignments. The assignments are a combination of written problems and programming exercises. Programs must written in C, C++ or Python and run on flip. For each assignment you will be told which libraries you can use. Students can discuss the homework questions with each other but must independently write up a solution. Assignments are to be submitted to Gradescope (written answers) and TEACH (code) by 11:59pm on the date.

## Quizzes:
There will be two in class quizzes on during week 4 and week 8, the exact dates listed in the schedule. You will have 50 minutes to complete each quiz. You will be allowed one 3”x5” note card for each quiz.

## In-Class Activities (ICA):
There are weekly in-class activities. Activities will be completed in groups during class and are due at the end of class. Your lowest activity score will be dropped.

## Final Exam:
The cumulative final exam will be given in class during finals week at the time scheduled for this class, Tuesday June 7th at 9:30am.

## Grading Policies:
1. Any requests for extensions/special accommodations must be made in advance, in writing and sent to the instructor via Canvas messaging.
2. Makeup Exams –Any requests for makeup exams must occur a week in advance to be considered.
3. Homework will be accepted up to 1 day late for a 10% penalty.
4. Any concerns in scoring must be addressed within one week of the work being graded. All questions about grading must be placed in the “Assignment Comments” section of the Canvas submission for that assignment.
5. Incompletes – In this online program, there will rarely be cases where an incomplete is appropriate. I will only consider giving an incomplete grade for emergency cases such as a death in the family, major disease, or child birth, while also having a passing grade. If you have a situation that may prevent you from completing the coursework, let me know as soon as you can.

## Grading Scale:  Note: Average score ranges given in interval notation

Grade | A | A- | B+ | B | B- | C+ | C | C- | D+ | D | D- | F
-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-
Score | 92+ | 91-90 | 89-87 | 86-82 | 81-80 | 79-77 | 76-72 | 71-70 | 69-67 | 66-62 | 61-60 | 59-

- *REMINDER: A passing grade for core classes in CS is a C or above. A C-, 72 or below, is not a passing grade for CS majors.*

## University Policies

### Academic Calendar:
All students are subject to the registration and refund deadlines as stated in the [Academic Calendar](https://registrar.oregonstate.edu/osu-academic-calendar.)

### Statement Regarding Students with Disabilities:
Accommodations for students with disabilities are determined and approved by Disability Access Services (DAS). If you, as a student, believe you are eligible for accommodations but have not obtained approval please contact DAS immediately at 541-737-4098 or at http://ds.oregonstate.edu. DAS notifies students and faculty members of approved academic accommodations and coordinates implementation of those accommodations. While not required, students and faculty members are encouraged to discuss details of the implementation of individual accommodations.  

### Face Covering Guidance & Public Health Policy:
The University’s guidance for face coverings will be upheld in the classroom.  Since the policy may change as the situation evolves please refer to the following link: https://covid.oregonstate.edu/face-covering-guidance-public-health-policy
 
### Expectations for Student Conduct:

### Reach Out for Success:
University students encounter setbacks from time to time. If you encounter difficulties and need assistance, it’s important to reach out. Consider discussing the situation with an instructor or academic advisor. Learn about resources that assist with wellness and academic success at oregonstate.edu/ReachOut . If you are in immediate crisis, please contact the Crisis Text Line by texting OREGON to 741-741 or call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255)

### Student Bill of Rights:
OSU has twelve established student rights. They include due process in all university disciplinary processes, an equal opportunity to learn, and grading in accordance with the course syllabus: https://asosu.oregonstate.edu/advocacy/rights
